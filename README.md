# WeatherApp
This is a sample weather app using OpenWeatherMapApi. </br>

Functionality : Displays a list of zipcodes. When you click on each zipcode you get the weather details in a new activity. You can also add new zipcodes to the list of zipcodes. 

Points of interest : Not much importance is given to the UI part of the app. It is just functional and minimal. Tried to make the code
as loosely coupled as possible.
